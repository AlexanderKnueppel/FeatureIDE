README:
Installation:
1. Install Eclipse Mars (Modeling Tool)
2. Install KeY (Branch pelevinaAbstractContracts) and KeY4Eclipse
3. Install FeatureIDE (https://github.com/kruegers/FeatureIDE):
	-de.ovgu.featureide.core
	-de.ovgu.featureide.core.featurehouse
	-de.ovgu.featureide.fm.core
	-de.ovgu.featureide.fm.ui
	-de.ovgu.featureide.ui
4. Install Featurehouse (https://github.com/kruegers/featurehouse), 
   perform the build and add the jar file to 
	de.ovgu.featureide.core.featurehouse/lib

For complete Verification with all six Verification Approaches over all projects:
1. Start an eclipse instance
2. Open the ProofAutomation View
3. Add the projects to workspace
4. Add key binary path in Configuration (key\system\binary) and the key library path (key\key-ext-jars)
(Optional: Add the path to de.ovgu.featureide.core.featurehouse.proofautomation.configuration.Configuration
in keyBinPath and keyLibsPath to avoid retyping)
5. Add the folder which contains all projects to Field "Directory"
6. Press Button "Start Evaluation"

For Verification with one Verification Approach over all projects:
1. Start an eclipse instance
2. Open the ProofAutomation View
3. Add the projects to workspace
4. Add key binary path in Configuration (key\system\binary) and the key library path (key\key-ext-jars)
(Optional: Add the path to de.ovgu.featureide.core.featurehouse.proofautomation.configuration.Configuration
in keyBinPath and keyLibsPath to avoid retyping)
5. Add the folder which contains all projects to Field "Directory"
6. Add the Verification Approach, that should be used to Field "Verification Approach" 
(1=EVEFI,2=Abstract Contracts,3=Concrete Contracts,4=Method Inlining with Dispatcher Methods,
5=Method Inlining without Dispatcher without Proof Reuse, 6= 5 with Proof Reuse)
7. Press Button "Start Evaluation of a single Phase"

For Verification of one Project with one Verification Approach:
1. Start an eclipse instance
2. Open the ProofAutomation View
3. Add the project to workspace
4. Add key binary path in Configuration (key\system\binary) and the key library path (key\key-ext-jars)
(Optional: Add the path to de.ovgu.featureide.core.featurehouse.proofautomation.configuration.Configuration
in keyBinPath and keyLibsPath to avoid retyping)
5. Add the folder of the Project to Field "Directory"
6. Add the Verification Approach, that should be used to Field "Verification Approach" 
(1=EVEFI,2=Abstract Contracts,3=Concrete Contracts,4=Method Inlining with Dispatcher Methods,
5=Method Inlining without Dispatcher without Proof Reuse, 6= 5 with Proof Reuse)
7. Press Button "Start Project Evaluation"


Remarks:
The Results are saved in the Directory, which was specified in "Directory", in a subdirectory "Evaluation" 
with finished Proofs, partial Proofs and an Overview for the Proofs (for single Projects, single Verification Approach, all Verification Approaches)
Additionally there are Output and Error Files for the execution of every project verification.

Missing or wrong key binary path results in a ClassNotFoundException

The Directory for complete Verification/ single Verification Approach contains every Project just once, e.g.
attempt 5/BankAccountv1, attempt 5/BankAccountv2, etc. and not a directory for every Verification Approach
